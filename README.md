# galileopy's personal CV

This as my own life is perpetual work in progress.

After many years honing my skills and getting out of the mainstream programming practice, I found myself with difficulties programming the way I like the best.

And because of that, this personal website is more of a testbed of my own ideas of how to code.

Right now I'm working on a small utility library that uses folktale and some of it's concept to write readable programs.

I also found some inspiration in [The Hikikomori's Guide to JavaScript](https://robotlolita.me/old-posts/2013-04-27-the-hikikomoris-guide-to-javascript).
